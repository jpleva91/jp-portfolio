# Portfolio Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Double Scrollbar Issue
**Problem**: Both `html` and `body` elements had `overflow-x-hidden` applied, which could cause double scrollbars in some browsers.

**Solution**: 
- Removed duplicate overflow rules
- Applied `overflow-x: hidden` only to the `body` element
- Added `max-width: 100%` to prevent content from extending beyond viewport
- Added `position: relative` to body for proper positioning context

**Files Modified**: `/home/jpleva/dev/jp-portfolio/src/styles.css`

### 2. Virtual Pet and Achievements Disappearing After Reload
**Problem**: Both modules were trying to append elements to `document.body` immediately when the modules loaded, before the DOM was ready.

**Solution**:
- Added DOM readiness check before initialization
- Prevented duplicate element creation on re-initialization
- Wrapped module instantiation in `DOMContentLoaded` event listener when needed

**Files Modified**: 
- `/home/jpleva/dev/jp-portfolio/src/virtual-pet.js`
- `/home/jpleva/dev/jp-portfolio/src/achievements.js`

## Testing Instructions

1. **Test Scrollbar Fix**:
   - Open the portfolio in a browser
   - Check that only one vertical scrollbar appears
   - Resize the window to ensure no horizontal scrollbar appears
   - Test on mobile viewport sizes

2. **Test Module Loading**:
   - Open the portfolio
   - Check that the virtual pet appears (cat emoji in bottom-right)
   - Check that the achievements button appears (trophy icon in bottom-left)
   - Reload the page (F5 or Ctrl+R)
   - Verify both elements still appear after reload
   - Open browser console and check for any errors

## Additional Notes

- The fixes ensure modules only initialize once, even if the scripts are loaded multiple times
- The DOM readiness checks prevent "Cannot read property of null" errors
- The CSS changes maintain responsive design while preventing unwanted scrollbars
